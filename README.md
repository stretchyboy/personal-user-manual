## About Me

Tall and geeky. I help students program and build robots.

## How to Contact Me

- Email is fine but I will always prefer a chat and an email to confirm details
- We use Teams a lot and that seems to suit me fine
- If you don't ask a question you may not get a reply ( Blindspot )

## Preferred Working Style

- I like mornings, and being in a school means that I'm an early starter.

## What Motivates Me

- Interested students
- Interested people who want to collaborate (even if it's as an owner / client not a developer)
- Coding / sovling real problems 
- Getting things going
- Robots, A-Frame, Creative Coding, Algorave

## What Demotivates Me

- I'm not great with on going admin type tasks
- 

## My Values (and what I value in others)

- Effort
- Care & Respect
- Creativity

## My Blind Spots

- Memory, I have an aquired brain injury and so I you just ask for a thing to be done, it will disappear in to the ether. Email things with clear dates or ask for access to my Trello / Planner
- I struggle to work in really loud / busy environments

## My Pet Peeves

- Other people not asking for help.

## Quirks
While this is a fun one, there is a temptation to hide behaviour here that probably should be worked on instead. Additionally, behaviour is complex, situation dependent and evolving. Stating you have a particular quirk makes it immutable and sets the expectation that you will always act like this. That said please feel free to include a section like this as it's a good icebreaker, and adds a personal touch. Just be aware that you might be unaware of some of your own "quirky" behaviour.

## What you can expect from me

Another one that might be useful for line managers, career coaches and mentors more than ICs. You may want to use this to set expectations around how often you'll be scheduling catchups, how you share feedback and what sort of support you can offer.
