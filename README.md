## About Me

Tall and geeky. I help students program and build robots.

## How to Contact Me

- Email is fine but I will always prefer a chat and an email to confirm details
- We use Teams a lot and that seems to suit me fine
- If you don't ask a question you may not get a reply ( Blindspot )

## Preferred Working Style

- I like mornings, and being in a school means that I'm an early starter.

## What Motivates Me

- Interested students
- Interested people who want to collaborate (even if it's as an owner / client not a developer)
- Coding / sovling real problems 
- Getting things going
- Robots, A-Frame, Creative Coding, Algorave

## What Demotivates Me

- I'm not great with on going admin type tasks
- 

## My Values (and what I value in others)

- Effort
- Care & Respect
- Creativity
- Geekiness

## My Blind Spots

- Memory : I have an acquired brain injury and so if you just ask for a thing to be done, it will disappear in to the ether. Email things with clear dates or ask for access to my Trello / Planner
- I struggle to work in really loud / busy environments

## My Pet Peeves

- Other people not asking for help.

## Quirks

- I'm a pedant : Sorry
- Ask the question you want answered
- I can't multitask - One question at a time please.
