## About Me

- He/him
- Tall and geeky. I help students program and build robots.

## How to Contact Me

- Email is fine but I will always prefer a chat and an email to confirm details & tasks
- We use Teams a lot and that seems to suit me fine
- If you don't ask a question you may not get a reply or confirmation ( Blindspot )

## Preferred Working Environment

- I like having my own desk space but can work anywhere for 2-3 hour periods / meetings. 
- But I'm really tall and have a special desk and chair at home and at my office base / classroom.
- I'm recovering from a broken leg so a high footstool is super useful atm.

## Preferred Working Style

- I like mornings, and being in a school means that I'm an early starter.
- I like having my own desk space but can work anywhere for 2-3 hour periods / meetings.
- I like having music or audio content on in the background. I prefer not to wear headphones but will happilly if others would prefer ( ask if I forget ).

## What Motivates Me

- Helping people
- Interested students
- Interested people who want to collaborate (even if it's as an owner / client not a developer)
- Coding / solving real problems 
- Getting things going
- Robots, A-Frame, Creative Coding, Algorave

## What Demotivates Me

- I'm not great with on going admin type tasks

## My Values (and what I value in others)

- Effort
- Care & Respect
- Creativity
- Geekiness

## My Issues

- Memory : I have an acquired brain injury and so if you just ask for a thing to be done, it will disappear in to the ether. Email things with clear dates or ask for access to my Trello / Planner
- I struggle to work in really loud / busy environments

## My Pet Peeves

- Other people not asking for help when they need it, my door is open, please don't struggle on your own. I don't know everything but I've been around a bit.

## Quirks

- I'm a pedant : Sorry
- Ask the question you want answered ( In programming, language is precise and I am annoying like that)
- I can't multitask - One question at a time please.
